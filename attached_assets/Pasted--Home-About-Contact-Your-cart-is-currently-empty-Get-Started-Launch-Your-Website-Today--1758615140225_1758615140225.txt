eCommerce
In 2007, we created our first eCommerce website called E-Tech Silicon Valley.

Owner & CEO Bruce Rezai ‚Äì a former NASA physicist & San Jose State University teacher ‚Äì placed his faith in our ability to deliver a cutting edge website that would compete with the likes of Amazon & NewEgg.

We quickly realized having an eCommerce business requires a well-oiled process in which the website is bringing in sales and the staff is able to quickly deliver. From bespoke packaging and SKU numbers for the warehouse, to daily ad-word optimizations, the operation was streamlined from A to Z.

The result? Over 1,000,000 in revenue in only 18 months.

Product Development
DealerClick, a major provider of Dealership Management Software was started in 1989 serving hundreds of dealerships nationwide.

Owner & CEO Kevin Mitchell, placed his faith in the team‚Äôs abilities to lead the way in creating the DealerClick 2.0. The team did a fantastic job of learning new programming languages, writing vast amounts of code tirelessly, mastering agile deployment, capable of competing with significantly larger companies.

My responsibility was generating document specifications, hiring, initial training, dispute resolution, support, partnership meetings and crucial problem solving.

Today, DealerClick is proud to offer their DealerClick 2.0 product with a near instant deployment process, easy support and an even more charming User Experience than ever before in its history.

Their former provider had provided a basic, well structured website that while technologically advanced, lacked the look and feel that the ambitious and soulful owners were looking for.

With that in mind, Nadvera created a website completely from scratch that integrates with their DealerClick DMS system, with additional technological advancements and a look and feel that shows the business in the best light possible.

Above and Beyond
Albert went above and beyond for our business on a Friday evening when our internet went down. Albert helped us with our internet connection to get our software system back up and running. For us, a small business, the extra effort in DealerClick‚Äôs Customer Support means the difference between making it and not being open. Thank you again Albert for the professionalism and courtesy shown by you and DealerClick.

Frequently Asked Questions
‚ÄúHow much does a website cost?‚Äù
Asking how much a website costs is a bit like asking how much it is to build a house. It all depends on what you‚Äôre looking for. Our base price for a 1-page website (using any platform) is $1499, which includes basic SEO and flawless design. High end SEO and custom eCommerce sites are cost extra depending on complexity of function and design.

‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt I design it Myself?‚Äù
You can design a website yourself, in fact I can teach you the basics on how to do it for a small consulting fee of $99/hr. This way, you‚Äôll actually be able to learn the craft from someone with over 20 years of experience.

‚ÄúCan I fix my existing WordPress website?‚Äù
Sure you can, but unless you have a lot of data specific to your site, we‚Äôd recommend starting from a clean sheet.

‚ÄúDo you provide support?‚Äù
Basic Support is included in every website package. Additional customization and consulting are charged on an hourly basis.
